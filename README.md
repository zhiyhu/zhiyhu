### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”® I'm dabbling into the data analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation and variant calling
- ðŸŽ‰ I'm super excited about using single-cell multi-omics to address biomedical questions
- ðŸ’¾ I'm using R (intensively), Python/Snakemake (frequently) and Shell (frequently). Had experience with C and MATLAB but cannot remember much. Always ready to learn new skills if necessary
