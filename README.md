### Hi there 👋

- 🔮 I'm dabbling into the data analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation and variant calling (okay, maybe speard too thin...😏)
- 🎉 I'm super excited about spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-modal but have not got a chance to start. Happy to collaborate on these topics
- 💾 I'm using R (intensively), python/snakemake (frequently) and shell (frequently). Had experience with C and MATLAB but cannot remember too much. Always ready to learn new skills if necessary
